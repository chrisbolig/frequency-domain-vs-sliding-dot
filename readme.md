# Code really demonstrates how fast convolution is in the frequency domain vs time domain. Code allows you to record anything you want from your computer speakers fin time seconds. You can scale down the resolution and save that recording to a path. You can then choose from a list of signals to convolve with your recording. (Please make your own!) You can you can then apply a discrete convolution - more like a sliding dot product. The result can be PAINFULLY slow or you can find both signals representation in the frequency domain and then multiply those arrays. You can play the recordings or the mixed signals, plot a comparison, and animate the convolution.
